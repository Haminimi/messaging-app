## Reflection
The project provided a great practice in authentication, authorization, REST API, connecting the frontend with the backend, working with MongoDB, and various other topics. There is a lot of space for expanding the app, however, I am very satisfied with the outcome and everything that I have picked up along the course of the project.

Note on JWT verification: Even though it is inconsistent approach, I have used both the Passport JWT strategy and custom JWT verification for the purpose of practice.
